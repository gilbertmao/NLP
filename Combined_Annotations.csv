7/20/2022,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I was written a check by my boss on XX/XX/2022 for an amount of {$1900.00}, and I attempted to deposit it on XX/XX/2022. He wrote it extremely poorly, so Chase Bank flagged it as an altered check. Instead of flagging just the check/bouncing it, or even notifying me that there was an issue, they restricted my entire account. I called them back on XX/XX/2022 in the evening after noticing that my account had been restricted. The representative of Chase Bank that I spoke with assured me that all I had to do was wait 5 business days from the initial deposit and if it was a "" good check '' ( as he put it ) then everything would be fine and the restrictions on my account would be lifted. He told me that all the funds in question would be in my account by XX/XX/2022. I checked my account on that day and the funds had been deposited. The next day ( XX/XX/2022 ), I noticed that Chase had closed my account and withdrawn all of my money, aside from {$270.00} ( cash ) which I had just deposited into the account through an ATM. I called them again that night irate, and they told me that they closed my account and withdrew my funds themselves because I had failed to contact them within 10 days to resolve the issue. That was completely not true as I did try to reach out to them and after being passed around between multiple representatives I was told that all I had to do was sit and wait till the 5th bushiness day was up, which is what I did. He then hung up on me without helping me resolve this issue. I could not call back again as they were then closed at that point. I had to call back again the next morning on Saturday ( XX/XX/2022 ) at XXXX XXXX  to discuss to figure out what was going on and why they closed my account. The person I spoke with said they were having issues with verifying who was writing me the check. He told me because I did not reach out within 10 days they closed my account. I told him that was absolutely not true. He also told me that part of the issue with verifying the check was that if I looked at the check I would see that the check says that the company and bank from which the funds were coming from was located in XXXX. That is not what was on the check. The address on the check was in XXXX, Pennsylvania. He then spoke with their "" backroom '' and eventually got approval to reach out to my boss directly and verify all the information with him. They did so and were able to get in contact with him. My boss verified everything with them, and the Chase representative then told me that everything had been verified and that he would go ahead and reopen my account and that all my funds would be returned by XXXX XXXX on Monday XX/XX/2022. I asked him thoroughly whether the request would start being processed on Monday ( XX/XX/2022 ) or if it would be finalized and if all the money in my account ( including the original check in question for {$1900.00} ) would be back in my account or all of my money that was previously in my account aside from the {$1900.00} would be back in the account. He told me that my account would be reopened and ALL of my money would be back in my account ( including the {$1900.00} ). I checked on Monday ( XX/XX/2022 ) and nothing had changed, so I called back again at the end of the day and asked again what was going on and why they hadn't reopened my account and put my money back in it. The representative I spoke with told me that their "" backroom '' was reviewing the request but that it would actually take time to fully process it and that it would be done by today ( Wednesday XX/XX/2022 ) at XXXX XXXX and to call back again if it wasn't due to their being another issue. This means that I was given misinformation yet again by the representatives about when the issue would be resolved by. I called back again today as I saw that my account had finally been reopened, but not all my money had been put back in it. All of my money aside from the {$1900.00} had been returned to my account. So, I called back again today ( XX/XX/2022 ) around XXXX XXXX to see what the issue was now. The representative told me she did not know why the rest of my money had not yet been returned to me but that it would take time and tried to assure me that it would eventually be back in my account and to just wait. She would not give me an estimated time frame of when my money would be returned to me as she was not able to see that information, so I asked to speak with her supervisor who would be able to provide me with this information. While doing so, she had the audacity to tell me that they were doing me a favor by reopening my account and returning my money to me after she had just admitted that they were at fault for all of this. She connected me with her supervisor who told me that my remaining money was being held and suspended by them and that a request to have my money returned to me still hadn't been filled out and submitted yet, so if I didn't call to check in again on what was going on, it likely would never have been sent. I checked with my boss before making this call and he told me that the money had still not been returned to his account either, meaning that Chase would have kept the money. The supervisor then kept me on the phone while she filled out the request and submitted it. When she had finished, she told me that it may take up to Wednesday ( XX/XX/2022 ) for all of my money to finally be returned to me. 

Throughout this whole process, they gave me no warnings or notifications that this was occurring and I had to rely on myself noticing these things happening to reach out and figure out what was going on. They also continued to provide me with misinformation every step of the way. I had to call and speak with them a total of 5 times over two weeks to make progress. For the past two weeks, they closed my account, and I did not have access to any of my money. They had the audacity to say they were doing me a favor by helping me out after admitting that this was all their fault. AND, it will still be "" at most '' another full week before I have access to all of my funds.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,DC,20016,,Consent provided,Web,7/20/2022,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,5791638,0,0

According to their explanations, the reoccurring payment was taken out on the due date but didn't post to my account until XXXX. They said the past due notice was system generated and they had no way of not generating that. This caused my account to be double paid in the same month because of their errors. My bills don't show the total amount due or a breakdown of the charges per my loan documents. I get a bill now and it shows it is due for twice the amount because according to the UAS representatives, the lender is choosing to bill that way and they have no control over the fact that is shows two months at a time on one bill. They said only pay the amount due for the month but I do not get anything showing what that is. Even when I go online, there is a current amount due but it also shows a greater amount due as the outstanding balance to pay with the due date of the current month.

1/24/2022,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Fraud or scam,,"Dear CFPB ; I am reporting a Wells Fargo ETF Fraud Scam on behalf of my wife and I. 

We have had all of the funds from three accounts stolen from us from our accounts via the XXXX transfer program. None of these transfers were authorized by either one of us. Our funds were transferred to a XXXX bank account. The XXXX program is added to all accounts by Wells Fargo automatically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we went to our local bank branch in XXXX XXXX, Fl and we reported this fraud to a customer service rep and the rep said we needed to file a claim to dispute the unauthorized online XXXX transfers totaling {$870.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX ( Original Claim # : XXXX ) and their fraud department would investigate the claim and let us know their decision within 7-10 business days. 

After about 10 business days, we received a letter that our claim was DENIED! The letter erroneously stated that the customer service rep said that we authorized these transfers! That was absolutely 100 % untrue!! 

After hearing this, we went to another branch on XX/XX/XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX branch and spoke with the branch XXXX XXXX. 

That XXXX was appalled at what they said after we told her we did NOT approve or authorize ANY of the XXXX transfers as this money was set aside for our bills and she agreed that we were wronged and she re-filed another fraud claim ( # XXXX ). We again were told that unfortunately it would be yet another 7-10 business days before we get their decision. 

The letter we received dated XX/XX/XXXX states that "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we finalized our investigation and denied the claim number XXXX. Claim number XXXX was resolved and closed. '' Also on page 2 of the same letter, it states "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we filed claim number XXXX to re-dispute unauthorized online XXXX transfers totaling {$870.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, and posted to accounts ending in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. At this time claim number XXXX is still under investigation and the resolution will be communicated to you under separate cover. '' It has now been 13 business days and we still do not have a decision! 

Under the following section on your website I read the following : Error Resolution : Unauthorized EFTs We reviewed section # 5 and that is exactly what happened, a fraudster contacted my wife on her cellphone and said he was from Wells Fargo bank and there were suspicious transfers being processed right now and he was trying to help stop that from happening and put the money back into her account and it should be back in the account within 24-48 hours. My wife did not give them ANY account information or personal information either, in fact, she asked the caller "" How do I know you are from Wells Fargo? '' He told her to look at his number and compare it to the number on the back of her card and the numbers matched. 

"" For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs.

As a result of these unsatisfactory responses, I filed a dispute with my bank on XX/XX/XXXX under reference number : XXXX. Unfortunately, my dispute was sided with your company due to the tracking evidence submitted, which I personally do not consider to be sufficient burden of proof. 

Furthermore, I noticed that the vendor had decided to ship out my items without a signature required and was not willing to further address the issue. I have attempted to resolve this matter as a responsible consumer by reaching out to the vendor, however, I was not given the opportunity to have a productive conversation. 

I was not satisfied with the outcome of my initial dispute and filed to reopen the dispute on XXXX XXXX to provide my side of the story, but this request was sided with the vendor again on XX/XX/XXXX. I am disappointed that the vendor simply copied and pasted the first evidence submitted in the dispute process and was unwilling to consider my perspective.

During that day, I was working from home in my apartment and my roommate can attest to this as a witness. I could also verify this from computer logs. In addition, the physical card was in my wallet the entire time. 

Although Bank of America initially credited the account for them, they quickly reversed it after only looking at one piece of information : that it was chip-based.

They never contacted me to ask for any evidence I could show to prove that it was not me. They never contacted the merchant to ask for receipts or video evidence.

They didn't ask me any further questions. 

The fact that they only looked at ONE piece of information and resolved it against their customer WITHOUT ever contacting them is frustrating to say the least. It causes tremendous physical and psychological stress to be the sole person responsible to gather all the evidence needed to prove my innocence. Despite the bank having a "" no fraud liability '', they did not attempt to help their customer at all. This is wholly unacceptable.

7/12/2022,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I filed a dispute with XXXX XXXX, they did their investigation and I do not agree with all of the results from their investigation. I'm not requesting money or claiming any type of monetary refund. I'm requesting a more accurate accounting of what really happened. 
According to their investigation an account was opened in my name in XXXX. I agree. It also states, "" information was verified as your information and XXXX opened an account. '' Well, this is totally questionable. What information? My name? My social security number? Because the address was not mine, the phone number was not mine, the email was not mine, I asked to see my signature and they couldn't produce anything. What kind of verification system does XXXX have anyway? So the statement that they verified my information is a half truth. 

They claim that "" the card and several additional mailings were mailed in your name to your valid address over the life of the account '', exactly when? I didn't know about the existence of the card until I got a XXXX order to access my wife 's business po box . Nothing came to my home. Once I contacted XXXX about the invoices found in her po box is when XXXX started contacting myself directly at my phone number, my email and my home address. 

I feel XXXX is mistaken and what they feel their findings reveal is not correctly interpreted. Double check your findings to make sure it is my address not my wife 's business address, email and cel number. 

Bottomline, my credit was issued to someone else without my knowledge. Whether I benefited or not is not the question. To that question, I paid the debt in full. 

The issue was ... the issuing of this credit without my knowledge cause problems at the time of my wife 's death due to probate and other circumstances, I had difficulty paying this debt I had no prior knowledge of. But despite all this, I did pay off the debt. I was trying to figure out how to pay it and it took some time. XXXX is just as guilty of causing this confusion as is my late wife. I'm the only one not guilty of anything. Yet I seem to be the only one being punished. The problem is not whether I paid or not, the problem is I didn't pay on time and what was the cause of delay. The cause of delay was not my fault. I should not be penalized for this. XXXX was a participant in the reason for the delay. 
That is all I'm saying and the report should reflect this. 

I think XXXX should reconsider their stance considering that I'm not requesting anything monetary. I'm not sure why the letter is listing refunds, I didn't ask for may money. I just do not want a blemish on my Credit history which I do not feel I deserve. I feel under the circumstances I took care of my credit obligation even though I wasn't fully convinced that the debt was mine. Technically the courts allowed me to pay from my wife 's estate after reviewing my situation. I don't understand why XXXX can not understand what the XXXX XXXX court system understood. 

Anyway, this is a matter of principle. I will take legal action if necessary. 
If that happens I will be looking for monetary gain. 

If XXXX actually has proof, my signature or proof of mailing invoices to my home address for the life of the account, or emails to my email address, etc... instead of claiming to have these records, how about showing it to all of us? 

Please understand, I had to dig deep into my wife 's finances and personal data to find the XXXX XXXX. Once found I contacted XXXX promptly to figure out what it was and how to resolve the situation to the benefit of both parties. If XXXX 's claim is correct and it was being sent to me, I wouldn't. have had to dig for it. 

I'm not above apologizing if I'm wrong. There is a chance I could be mistaken but so far, I don't see how. But showing us the record of what XXXX claims to have would finish this dispute promptly.

Therefore, if I were to reimburse you and they find an occupancy discrepancy, I would have paid you to do business with me.

I have had 6 audits so far this year with no issues, but since new material has come to light, I need to be sure I will not end up in the negative.

If I made {$100.00} in purchases the same day I took out a cash advance of {$100.00}, by the end of the billing cycle if all was the same, the Cash Advance would have higher balance. The representatives at CapitalOne stated that only the actual numeric value of the APR matters, not anything else.

7/22/2021,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Unexpected increase in interest rate,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Care Credit to make my {$53.00} payment for my dental bill. I found out my balance had gone up and wondered why so I called and found out that the account had a promotion which expired XX/XX/XXXX. I spent an hour trying to get through to a person and then when that customer service person XXXX could not help me, he transferred my call to "" someone '' who could review my account. After an hour 45 minutes no one ever answered. I started the call at XXXX XXXX and hung up at XXXX XXXX.then I attempted another call XX/XX/XXXX, but did not have time to hold. No one ever answers the XXXX # in an appropriate length of time. 

That is my 1st complaint. My 2nd complaint is when I asked for some help since I can`t afford to pay {$600.00} ( or I wouldn't have a credit card ) no alternative was provided. Customers are not listened to. I have not used this card at all this year in an effort to try to pay it down, I even had to decline needed dental treatment trying to take care of this balance. I shouldn't have to think that way, but this is how this company treats its customers, they are unprofessional and unfair in the way they treat consumers. My most glaring complaint is that it should be noted there was a consent decree for this very same practice where consumers were ordered by the CFPB to be refunded for deceptive credit practices by Care Credit. My XX/XX/XXXX bill I was charged {$270.00} for a bill that had a balance of {$650.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. That is a 44 % interest rate. The balance is now {$1200.00}. The breakdown for this balance is totally not decipherable. 

It shows purchase amount of {$310.00} with a 26.99 % interest rate. And on the next line it shows Deferred interest expired for the amount of {$930.00} this includes the amount of {$270.00} interest that was charged on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I reviewed many of my previous bills and they all state it is a fixed interest rate until paid in full. Refer to bill dated XX/XX/XXXX. I had an available credit of {$2400.00} a payment amount due of {$53.00} a month which I have paid on time each month and a interest ratre of 9.99 %. - I am not sure why they changed my terms but I just want my monthly payment and no promo with my 9.99 % interest. 

I have no hope that Care Credit will resolve this, after my third phone call today, to XXXX, he could or would not help and transferred me to XXXX, who said I had to place my dispute in writing - she would not take it over the phone. I am very upset at the length of time I have had to spend to do their job. If I worked this way, I would not have a job. 
The consent decree states that complaints must be accepted either by phone or in writing and resolved within 30 days. Since they are requiring my dispute in writing, this company is in violation and I want a resolution to that as well as to my complaint. If they are in violation of the consent order, there are funds that can be refunded to affected consumers. I am very much affected. 

Please send a response to what can be done to help me resolve this. I don't mind continuing with the credit card as long as they leave it at an interest rate with no promo deferred interest and reverse the {$270.00} charge and any negative reporting to the credit bureau is amended and a copy of the amended order to the credit bureau is sent to me and kept on my file.

I have since XXXX made numerous offers to settle The lien at 80 % of the foreclosed amount on my property, to no avail. About 3 years ago, I stumbled onto a XXXX XXXX Bank phone number that had records on my property. I was informed by personal, that XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. Had sold a block of interest which included my property, to Ocwen, the company that had been the servicer of the property perviously. 

After extensive research. I learned that Ocwen, has failed to complete the necessary and/or any of the documents that would transfer title from XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX to Owen. I have made numerous calls to XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. Executive branch recovery Department, informing them of Ocwens failure to transfer title, needed maintenance of my property which requires permits, and, my foundation which is in major disrepair following the damages from hurricane IDA. By law they are required to fix this issues. But, refuse. 

I have included copies from CFPB in which XXXX XXXX Bank, replied they have nothing to do with my property. County land records showing XXXX XXXX Bank is the recorded owner.

However, 2 years later, same law firm now stating they are attorney in fact for PHH Mortgage Corporation, for XXXX XXXX Bank, XXXX, As Trustee for XXXX Mortgage Loan Trust XXXX, Mortgage -pass Though Certificates, Series XXXX. Copies included. I also, have a pending appellate action. 

I am reaching out to Government agencys In hopes of opening their eyes, and realizing the fraudulent activities of Ocwen, PHH Mortgage Corporation, and prey they be held accountable for their lackadaisical record keeping, and loopholing ways, that have the Banks continuing to pay the property insurance, and property taxes on homes they no longer own.

And, have carefully scrutinized my portfolio, to make sure my investments are safe from these predators. These are publicly traded stocks, and laws are being ignored. So not only am I being taken advantage of, there are hundreds of investors that have no idea their losing monies daily. Which begs the question, how many are facing the same obstacles as I? And, whos paying the attorneys fees? And, why is the property insurance inaccessible to fix my homes issues. Where is the accountability? and over-site?

Companies like Ocwen and PHH Cooperation are double dipping, making millions. Whilst, I continue to defend myself against being unlawfully evicted from my home.

My complaint is with XXXX XXXX. Near the end of XX/XX/XXXX my normal billing jumped to over {$300.00} because of International phone calls from XXXX using my late wife 's phone number. The next month the total went to over {$800.00} for even more calls from XXXX. All my attempts to talk to "" managers '' at XXXX about obviously fraudulent charges originating from a country that I have never visited. In fact I haven't been out of the U.S.A. in over 20 years. 

Sometime around XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I personally went to the XXXX store in XXXX XXXXXXXX, ID to have my wife 's phone number disconnected and change the account to my name and surrender her phone because I certainly did not need it any longer. 
They made a really big deal about changing that account ( they even required me to provide an original death certificate! ). The whole process took several hours and I was very frustrated but it needed to be done. And I thought that the account change was completed. 

When I started receiving the billing for international calls I noticed that the calls were using my late wife 's, supposedly disconnected and returned cell phone. Despite all my calls to fix the fraudulent charges they had no record of the number being disconnected or returned. I've searched my records and I can't find proof as well. So, either they never gave me official paperwork of I have disposed of it after a few months. 

They have since sold the debt to a debt collection agency and my money manager has sent them a cease and desist letter. They did cease. Now I have to go through this all over again because XXXX sold the debt to another debt collection agency that is now demanding {$990.00} for interest fees and costs. 

I just need to talk to someone at XXXX headquarters ( maybe with a moderator ) that has common sense that can see that these international charges from XXXX are obviously fraudulent.

2/16/2021,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"My husband and I purchased a car in XXXX brand new and were financed through a company called Global Lending Service based in South Carolina. 

In XXXX of XXXX, our city was hit by a tornado and several trees were struck down. One tree in particular covered the entire southbound lane of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 2 lane street ). To avoid hitting another vehicle head on, my husband and oldest daughter were forced to hit the tree that occupied the entire lane. 

In short the SUV was declared a total loss on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX our insurance company released a partial payment for the value of the vehicle in the amount of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Gap Insurance paid an additional XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. NOW Global Lending Service is saying I owe a balance of XXXX. They are saying this amount accrued for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I'd not heard anything from Global Lending about an amount outstanding or owed until XX/XX/XXXX when they charged off my loan for that which remained. 

How is this fair business practice? I was never notified that XXXX paid a partial payment until I noticed the loan reporting as delinquent on my credit bureau. 

1. My credit score dropped over 60 points for an accident that was an act of nature 2. I was not given any notice that a balance existed on my loan I was told it was totaled and they were waiting for a payment from XXXX in XXXX my previous months car payment had been paid current. 
3. No one from Global Lending Service attempted to contact me until XX/XX/XXXX. So from XXXX I'd accrued this outstanding amount and I see this as unfair and poor customer service. 

I've spoken to several people at Global Lending Service who are offering a settlement however I am without a car, left with a negative credit score as a result of something that was beyond my control. 

Who can help me, and how can this be mitigated in the future as potentially other customers are at risk.

I have sent them numerous letters and they still fail to comply with the fcra laws! They are sending me responses about verified but have not sent me my wet ink signature contact or whom they spoke to, to verify these accounts. 

This is what was sent to the credit reporting agencies ( XXXX AND XXXX ) : To whom it may concern, Ive recently received my credit report and noticed violations under the 15 us code 1681 and 15 us code 1681b ( FCRA ). The law clearly states the following15 us code 1681b ( a ) In general Subject to subsection ( c ), any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates.

Meaning that if you do not have or havent gotten any written instructions from me ( the consumer ) to furnish an account on my report. It should not be there. That is a violation. I never gave written instruction to furnish any of the following accounts.

Secondly according to the 15 us code 1681.The law clearly states : 1. Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting. The Congress makes the following findings : 2. The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system ( 4 ) There is a need to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

( b ) Reasonable procedures It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.

The following accounts are inaccurate and are in clear violation of my privacy. Which is a violation of the law. This is too embarrassing and damaging to my reputation as a consumer. This has been very stressful on me mentally and physically. I need financing for a car and this inaccurate report is hindering me. As the consumer I demand the following accounts be removed from my credit report immediately. 

XXXX XXXX & XXXX Account Number : XXXX FROM CREDIT REPORTS In addition I demand to have a copy of my updated consumer report once the following changes have been made.

This is what I sent to EQUIFAX and they still failed to comply!! 

To Whom It May Concern : This notice is to inform you that you are unlawfully reported an unauthorized account on my consumer report. I have not given you written permission to put anything on my credit profile. You have no permissible purpose by law to contact third parties with my private or personal information. Your offenses amount to Aggravated Identity Theft pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1028A. You have knowingly transferred, possessed, or used, without lawful authority, a means of identification of me, which is a felony punishable with up to 2 years of imprisonment, in addition to civil liability.

This agency is in violation of 15 USC 1692g. They were to notify me of this in writing 5 days prior, I was not. As the original creditor only, I can validate this debt. I do not validate this debt. Therefore, the following accounts must be deleted from my report.

Failure to respond satisfactorily with deletion of the above referenced account, and send out a free copy of my report after the changes have been made will result in legal actions being taken against your company, for which I will also be seeking {$1000.00} per violation for : Defamation of Character ( per se ) Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud Fair Debt Collections Practices Act 15 USC 1692g violations Fair Credit Reporting Act 15USC 1681 violations for willful noncompliance - 616.

( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b.

I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ).

7/22/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Other transaction problem,,"Hello, I would like to report a complaint related to the Coinbase ( Coinbase XXXX  , Inc. ) cryptocurrency exchange platform. They refuse to refund my crypto funds. I faced a problem of accidental transferring my XXXX  crypto funds from the Coinbase Wallet directly to XXXX  address in Coinbase Exchange and my money got stuck/was lost ( not showing in my portfolio balance ).

The thing is, - I successfully sold my NFT item on XXXX XXXX and the money showed up in my account ( Coinbase Wallet ) as XXXX instead of XXXX  so I assumed they were interchangeable. 

At the beginning, I didn't even assume that the cryptocurrencies must be manually converted and XXXX/ETH are completely different cryptocurrencies and it's possible to wrap XXXX from XXXX ... It was all new to me ... 

I used only their Coinbase-related services ( Wallet and Exchange ) and transaction hash shows that it is successful, providing the link below : XXXX XXXX XXXX If you check my XXXX ( to which I transferred my lost XXXX  funds ) using XXXX  link above, - you can clearly see that it actually holds my money.

This means that they have not disappeared and are actually stored in this XXXX XXXX that is controlled/owned by Coinbase.

But Coinbase tech support keeps telling me that : "" Cryptocurrency transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, meaning once they are sent, there is no way to recover funds. "".

However, XXXX  is an ERC20 token so they should be able to access it from the Ethereum wallet address I sent it to. ERC-20 tokens ( XXXX  ) and XXXX  use the same addresses so they can be recovered. The Ethereum chain supports ERC20 tokens.

XXXX XXXX  address is a valid ERC20 address, meaning I can send any ERC20 token to it. The coins I sent would technically be sitting in a wallet that Coinbase controls.

Ive been trying to get this problem corrected since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX  has been hurting my ability to refinance my mortgage to a lower interest rate. I have disputed this problem with the Transunion and XXXX credit bureaus on at least 3 occasions. And, on at least 3 times provided proof from XXXX XXXX XXXX  that I was not delinquent or past due to XXXX XXXX XXXX Research Department and Customer Service with no fair treatment and still unfair credit reporting from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Please see the attached proof from my credit reports showing XXXX XXXX XXXX  or its loan servicer, XXXX XXXX Mortgage reporting that Im delinquent or past due in making mortgage payments. Please also see my XXXX XXXX XXXX  Forbearance Letter, and my bank statements that show I was not delinquent in making any mortgage payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX  before the loan was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and its loan servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 


I have exhausted all my efforts trying to resolve this problem. I was current on my mortgage payments and I had never missed a payment before being approved for loan forbearance. My current mortgage company, XXXX XXXX Mortgage, has been reporting that Im past due since XX/XX/XXXX even though the forbearance rules and this companys forbearance policy informs that there would be no negative credit reporting. My loan was transferred from XXXX XXXX Mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX  during XX/XX/XXXX. I was in active approved forbearance with XXXX XXXX XXXX  from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX until XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I was approved for forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX before my loan was transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  does not treat Veterans fairly since they continue to wrongfully report to the credit bureaus that Veterans do not pay on time and that they are past due in making mortgage payments. Moreover, in the year and half that Ive been asking XXXX XXXX XXXX  to correctly report my mortgage payment history, I could have had a 2.2 interest rate instead of my current 3.25 interest rate and saved a lot of money. 

Today, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  is continuing to sabotage my credit rating by reporting to Transunion and XXXX credit bureaus that Im 30 days or not more that 2 months past due. XXXX XXXX Mortgage has cost me a lot of money and a lot pain and agony. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received alerts from Transunion and XXXX credit bureaus that XXXX XXXX XXXX  is erroneously and wrongfully reporting that Im past due in making my mortgage payments. Again, I have always made my mortgage payments on time. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  and its loan servicer, XXXX, persist on reporting the Department of Veterans Affairs approved and guaranteed partial claim promissory note balance of {$19000.00} is past due, which is against the forbearance policies and the Fair Credit Reporting Act of unfair, wrongful credit reporting. Over one and half years and XXXX XXXX XXXX and its loan servicer, XXXX, will not follow the laws and rules. 


It is obvious to me that XXXX XXXX XXXX  and its loan servicer, XXXX, do not care to follow the forbearance rules and blatantly do not support XXXX Veterans trying to stay in their homes as well as improve their lot in life. Also, XXXX XXXX XXXX  and its loan servicer, XXXX, have proven that they both plan to continue to unfairly prevent me from refinancing my loan with another mortgage company. XXXX XXXX XXXX  and its loan servicer, XXXX, are not fair to Veterans and it is not a Veteran-friendly mortgage servicer. 


My date of last activity for mortgage payments was paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Please see the attached XXXX XXXX XXXX payments ACH tracking information extracted from my bank account transactions. I made all my payments on time per the mortgage contract. 


Moreover, XXXX XXXX XXXX and its loan servicer, XXXX, forbearance policies informs that there will not be any negative reporting.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my case manager and after much discussion was told that my fax had never been received and I would have to open another reconsideration and resubmit documents either via fax or physical mail as email is not an option and she could not send them for me or reopen a reconsideration. I was told it is my responsibility to ensure documents are received, but did not have an advice as to how exactly I am supposed to do that since I am not given the contact details of the person reviewing my claim, or the department at all. Nor did she consider that it was a Wells Fargo employee that faxed the documents and at this point the document contents should be considered conferred to the claims and fraud department. She also could not explain why I was never contacted to provide substantiating documents except to say that COVID changed protocols. I expressed that I believe their process for claims equates to bad faith as it denies claims due to lack of substantiationg but then puts roadblocks in the way of substantiating and she said she agrees. After I told her that made them liable to me for failure to uphold their fiduciary duty to me, she backpedaled and said she only personally agrees and is still investigating. As an employee of Wells Fargo faxed the information to the fraud department and verbally affirmed to me that it was received, I believe Wells Fargo has failed in their duty to fairly and thoroughly investigate this fraud claim or has willfully chosen to ignore the facts and their actions are tantamount to illegal bad faith.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MT,597XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/12/2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4537005,0,1

1. On XX/XX/XXXX, Experian got from a request from me for there method of verification as it pertains to a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX account listed on my credit report. The account number for that account is XXXX. Its been more than 5months since that request was made and I have not gotten that Method of Verification. All I have gotten from Experian are letters stating that the account is reporting accurately on my credit report, and they will not investigate the matter further and this is a clear violation of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The law states that I have a right to request this information and if the Credit Bureau is unable to provide this information, then the account should be deleted from the credit report. I am currently speaking to a lawyer about this. 
2. On the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX account listed on my credit report it says that the address associated with this account has an INDENTIFICATION NUMBER AND THAT NUMBER IS XXXX. Now there is no such address listed on my credit report with such an identification number. My address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Florida XXXX and this address has a different identification number. So, who is that address and identification number associated with as its not associated with me, and that address with that identification is not listed on my credit report. 
3. 
On my Experian Credit Report, it says that the account was paid in full with a zero-dollar balance and that the last payment was received XX/XX/XXXX. So, if the account was paid in full on the XX/XX/XXXX as according to the credit report and the account was in good standing in XX/XX/XXXX then how can it be that Experian is reporting that the account went into a charged off status in XX/XX/XXXX. There is incorrect account and payment information. There is also missing payment and account information and this makes the credit incomplete and if a credit report IS INCOMPLTE, THEN THE FAIR CREDIT ACT SAYS THAT IT SHOULD BE DELETED. This is the account that Experian says that is reporting accurately on my credit report and this is totally false. 
4. Based of Experian erroneous reporting of this matter on my credit report has prevented me from getting funding to getting my business off the ground. I have been disputing this account for months now showing the various inaccuracies as it pertains to this account reporting on my credit report. I am tired of filing disputes with Experian, and they never take me seriously. So, if they continue to claim that this account is reporting accurately on my credit report and or fail to provide me with proof that I am responsible for this account then I will ask my lawyer to proceed to take action against Experian as I am sick",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,32811,,Consent provided,Web,12/10/2021,Closed with non-monetary relief,Timely response?,,4998564,1,0

Exhibits were attached in the form of my actual credit report. I am hoping to receive a reply but in the interim, I am filing a complaint ; as my rights have been violated.

Please see below explanations. 


1. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act section 15 USC 1692e I as a consumer have the right to not be violated by the communicating of any credit information that is known or should be known to be false. There is no proof nor validation of this debt. Therefore, it SHOULD be known to be false in accordance with the above. In addition, I have never been presented with any affidavit that would provide validity to neither you nor the alleged debt collectors assessment. 

2. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act section 15 USC 1692e the said debt collector must not use any false nor deceptive/misleading representation. This includes but is not limited to the use of any business, company, or organization name other than the TRUE NAME of the debt collectors business, company or organization. None of the alleged debts have been validated nor represented by the original creditor. And there is reason to believe these alleged debts were sold. If these alleged debts were indeed soldWhere is the proof of the alleged debtors approval? This too is a violation of consumer rights pursuant to 15 USC 1692d ( 4 ). 

3. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act I as a consumer have the right to privacy and my privacy has been breached. According to my credit report, there has been alleged debts published without my permission ; using my name and personal information by which to do. 

4. According to the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act section 15 USC 1692d I as a consumer have the right to not be harassed, oppressed or abused in connection to any alleged debt. The publishing of this false information has done all of such. It has prevented me as a natural person from my rights to attain both material and physical comforts in order to safely and effectively support myself and my family. It has caused abuse by-way-of embarrassment due to the constant declination I have faced when trying to pursue this said right. It has sabotaged both my name and my creditability. 

6. Pursuant to 15 USC 1681a ( 2 ) ( b ) any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device should be excluded from a consumer report. The definition of a credit card pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( l ) is any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining, money, property, labor, or services on credit. Hence, my social security card. In fact, my social security card with its attached number would have had to be used to transact any of the alleged debts listed. Therefore, pursuant to the above, this is a violation of my rights as a federally protected consumer.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MI,48047,,Consent provided,Web,8/5/2021,Closed with explanation,Timely response?,,4605276,1,0

6/10/2022,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Context : I opened a checking and savings account with Citizens Bank on XX/XX/XXXX to get a lower interest rate on the student loans I had just refinanced with them. Part of the requirement was to deposit money into the accounts, so I put an initial {$100.00} into both. As this is not my primary bank, my goal was to just deposit money into the savings account each week and use the automatic withdrawal to pay my loans each month. 

Initial issue : While I regularly logged into the app to check my savings account, unfortunately, I was not paying attention to my checking since I was not using it. On XX/XX/XXXX, it caught my attention as the {$100.00} I had initially deposited had turned into a - {$9.00} balance. To my surprise, I had been getting charged a {$9.00} "" Service Charge '' each month. I quickly contacted customer service and was informed that Citizens Bank charges this fee when there is no activity in the account. The only requirement to avoid this fee is to deposit a minimum of {$0.00} each month. During this 12-month span of being charged this fee, I was not contacted by Citizens, nor made aware this inactivity was causing my investment to deplete. I opted out of paper statements, however, there is nothing evident in the app, such as a notification, that would have made me aware of the situation, nor did I receive any emails, which they have on file. The digital statements are not easily accessible on the app, and I would have no reason to check them anyway since I was not using the account. Clearly, I would have deposited a mere one cent had I known this was going on. Especially since {$260.00} of my paycheck is being deposited into my savings each week, I would have happily put some of that toward my checking to avoid this erroneous fee. Luckily, the customer service agent was able to reimburse 3 of those fees, however, it still put me at a {$79.00} loss at the time. 

Why I'm filing a complaint : After speaking with customer service, I went to the account to set up automatic transfers. It was then that I noticed my account had been "" inactivated, '' so I was unable to make any deposits or transfers out of the account. Due to this, I assumed the account was essentially closed and would not incur any new fees. How could I if I was unable to perform the action that allowed me to avoid the fee? Well, on XX/XX/XXXX I logged on and sure enough, I was charged the fee. This time, I called customer service to explain the situation and request the fee be reimbursed and after a long conversation with the rep and supervisor, I was informed that they could not reimburse the fee. The reason being they had already given me 3 courtesy reimbursements and the system would not allow them to do a XXXX. I explained this was not a courtesy, it was an error on their end for their system not allowing me to make a deposit, yet still penalizing me for not doing so. I also argued that the customer service rep I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX should've informed me my account was inactive and I would not be able to make any deposits if that was the case, to which the new agent agreed.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",CT,063XX,,Consent provided,Web,6/10/2022,Closed with explanation,Timely response?,,5655302,0,0

The note, however, was never delivered. HUD 's servicing company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stated in a XXXX letter, that it never received the original note from XXXX, and the record shows there is no Lost Note affidavit from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to HUD, nor from HUD in its putative assignment to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC has admitted that the note is lost. 
Actual assignment requires delivery of the note, or else a Lost Note affidavit. As there is no Lost Note affidavit of record from XXXX to HUD or from HUD to XXXX, then clearly, there was no assignment of the note in either case. Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC has repeatedly attempted to foreclose without the note, without a chain of title, and without any basis whatsoever. 
In XXXX I sent Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC four Notices to prove-up its right to enforce the instrument pursuant to Maryland Code Commercial Law 3-309 ( a ) A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if ( i ) the person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occured or, has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred. And 3-309 ( b ) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection ( a ) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person 's right to enforce the instrument. SLS has failed/refused to prove up its right to enforce the instrument in violation of 3-309 ( b ). 
Moreover, each of the alleged assignments in the alleged chain of title is an "" assignment '' of the deed of trust, not the note. In Carpenter v. Longan - 83 U.S. 271 ( 1872 ), the court ruled that The note and mortgage are inseparable ; the former as essential, the latter as an incident. An assignment of the note carries the mortgage with it, while an assignment of the latter alone is a nullity. Every alleged assignment in the alleged chain of title is an assignment of the Deed of Trust, and, as stated above assignment of the latter alone is a nullity. This constitutes evidence of record that every alleged assignment in the purported chain of title is defective rendering the instrument unenforceable.

The situation took place in 2016 and to this day it has not been resolved. My credit score has not improved since. Please help me! I do not know what else I can do. Here are the details : Macy 's damaged my credit score by continued monthly fee charges on my account that was closed back in XX/XX/2016 (! ) via the phone. At that time Macy 's representative assured me that my account is fully paid and closed. 
Shockingly in XX/XX/2016 I received a letter from Macy 's stating that I owe hundreds of dollars! I talked to yet another representative who checked my account and assured me that it was a mistake on Macy 's part, and it will be taken care of within the next 30 days. I asked and received a written confirmation dated XX/XX/2016 ( copy is attached ). 
Early in XX/XX/2016 I discovered that nothing changed on my Macys account and my great credit score was badly damaged by Macy 's reporting of the incorrect & damaging information to the credit reporting agencies. 
In XX/XX/2016 I talked to multiple representatives at Macy 's : Customer Service, Disputes Department and other groups spending hours on the phone over the course of a few weeks. NOTHING has been done so far. The superficial fee is still there and accruing and most importantly, my credit score is still very low.

Every time I called, I had to explain this situation all over again, being transferred from a person to person, being disconnected in about half of the calls. I call again, explain again, suffer bad connection, being put on holds, calls being dropped or promised that the situation will be resolved and asked to call back in a few days. Only to repeat this vicious circle all over again. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I shared my story on XXXX and a Macys rep responded and promised to help. However, nothing has changed, and my credit score have not improved since despite my diligent payment on my utilities and other bills.

Sadly, my story in not rare. Search the internet for Macy 's Credit Card fraud/issues to see other customers stories of suffering.

The only account of the money was I was told my payment would be {$780.00} per month because of the grant.

A few more days later they wrote me again and said my payment was raised again. a few more days they again wrote me saying the same thing.

I also did not receive any updated terms or conditions between this statement and previous statement so this is clearly an erroneous charge.

9/16/2022,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud,"I was very confident about opening my new US Bank account on XX/XX/2022. I have been gradually transferring my retirement and 401K funds from my XXXX Account into this new account over the last few weeks and have much more to complete. 

Unfortunately, the teller that opened my checking and savings account illegally accessed my consumer credit report and attempted to open a credit card without my permission. 

We sat together at the desk and discussed the offer to open such an account which I verbally declined. He told me that I needed to open a credit card account to avoid fees. I explained to him that since I am over XXXX that US Bank will not charge me monthly fees, which he was not aware of. I also explained that my credit score was only XXXX that week due to an emergency the previous month when i had to quickly max out my current XXXX credit cards. I knew I would be declined and dont need an additional card at this time. I said that in the future I would apply for the US Bank card. I am VERY well-informed about repairing my credit score so that I can refinance my current car loan soon and possibly buy a home in the future. I am more cognizant of the credit game than your average person. 

Additionally, the teller ordered preprinted checks for my account after I declined preprinted checks. I told him that I would purchase some online from another company and he provided me with some counter checks. Hilariously, the checks that he ordered are NOTHING that I would have ordered. They were of a political nature and my political views, although personal, have nothing to do with those checks. He read my WRONG. The bank manager refunded those checks and shredded them for me. 

It always seems to me that US Bank pressures its employees to meet sales goals as part of their job requirements, offering them incentives for selling bank products because I am literally asked every single time I walk up to a teller at the branch if I want a US Bank credit card. I have told all XXXX of them, repeatedly, no, that I needed to raise my credit score first. They could attest to that if asked. Also, why would I say yes to one person and not the others or tell them that I had already applied? The answer is because I had no knowledge that an application had been submitted. 

The bank employee illegally accessed my customer credit report and personal data to open an account without my permission. I am requesting that the inquiry for credit be rescinded as it was fraudulent. 

I was taken advantage of by misappropriation of my consumer data to create a fictitious account for which employees now receive incentives only for accounts where the customer uses the service. U.S. Banks conduct harmed my financial opportunities in the form of a potential unwanted account and a negative effect on my credit profile. 

the only measure that was taken by the bank manager was to ask me if I had read the 1/4 inch form that the teller handed me which she said had my signature approving the inquiry. When I signed the tiny screen approving my new checking and savings account, after declining the offer for a credit card, I never gave it another though.

The problem is with Experian. When the mistake happened it lowered my Experian score 34 points. When the mistake was removed it only returned 13 points.

Her mother made the same transaction on her new account on the same day for the same amount, using a MasterCard. Her transaction was also processed as a cash advance, but a quick call to customer service waived the fees. 

I called the PNC Bank credit card customer service and spoke to a manager. They declined to refund the fees because the "" transaction was valid ''. It was processed as a cash advance because of some properties of the transaction that aren't visible to me but are handled by the merchant/VISA. 

A "" Cash Advance '' is a distinct financial service that I did not request but that I unwittingly got, along with the fees and a hit to my FICO score.

602. Congressional findings and statement of purpose [ 15 U.S.C. 1681 ] ( a ) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting.

Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.

( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy.

( b ) Reasonable procedures. It is the purpose of this title to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this title.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,SC,29730,,Consent provided,Web,11/5/2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4883251,1,0

The XXXX employee had the contract my father signed rescinded and within 3 days, a Vivint employee took the equipment to the post office and sent it back to XXXX. This was XX/XX/2015.

( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers. 
( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

I had been in an accident, only had liability insurance, and ended up paying the towing company what I owed them for the tow and storage, and signed the title of the vehicle over to them. I called the tow company immediately to ask about it and they had no record of me owing them anything and in fact said that I was not even in their system because it happened so long ago.

4/23/2021,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Other personal consumer report,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I was browsing the web looking for a "" free '' website just to obtain current mortgage interest rates. The site I chose did not identify itself. It turned out to be Quicken Loans. I am not ready to purchase a new home. Before I was even off the site my phone rang and it was XXXX from Quicken Loans. He was very aggressive and unfortunately I found myself giving out me and my husband 's personal information including our Social Security numbers and details allowing Quicken Loans to give me a quote on current rates. XXXX did not want to talk at all. Just the facts. He then stated he had to go to a meeting but would return my call. I asked him to NOT RUN A CREDIT INQUIRY UNTIL HE CALLED ME BACK. I'm positive the call was recorded. After a few hours and trying to reach him, I just received his voice mail. I called Quicken Loans back again and got a woman named XXXX in Customer Relations Department. She stated Quicken had in fact already ran the inquiry but she would look into my complaint. In the meantime. My phone has been blowing up with spam calls all day and I have listened to voice messages about my "" mortgage loan application '' from companies I had never heard of. I believe Quicken Loans shared our personal information with other companies. They are affiliated wit Rocket Mortgage but I am also receiving calls from XXXX XXXX and other companies I never contacted. XXXX called yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX. I told her I wanted out personal information purged/deleted from their system. She stated that would take up to 45 days. Then she said in order to facilitate this request I needed to answer XXXX security questions. She then asked me what my height was on my driver 's license. She proceeded to give me multiple choice answers and did say my correct height. I answered that. The next question really upset me. She named my daughter 's full name and asked what state she resided in. The last question was "" what was the color of your XXXX XXXX XXXX? '' I no longer own this car but again she started with multiple choice answers and I answered that as well. I am furious that Quicken Loans had an image of my Georgia Drivers License and knew my child 's name and what car I used to drive. Also she stated if my husband wanted his personal information deleted/purged he would have to call her himself. She would not allow me to do this, although Quicken Loans had no issue with me giving them the personal information on the first call, which was Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. So now my husband has made attempts to call XXXX at Quicken Loans. Her direct number is XXXX. Quicken Loans is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MI, XXXX. Their main phone number is XXXX. I have good reason to believe Quicken Loans shared me and my husbands Social Security numbers, cell phone numbers and other personal information such as images of our driver 's licenses and information regarding my family and previous addresses and my children 's current addresses. My phone has been ringing non stop all day with suspected spam calls and other companies have left voice messages regarding "" my current mortgage loan ''. I have not contracted with anyone in order to obtain a mortgage or pre qualify for a mortgage. I was simply searching the web for free current rates. I urge others if you are looking to refinance a current mortgage or shopping for a new loan, use your local bank or credit union. Quicken Loans is very aggressive and I believe this is fraud. I contacted XXXX and put a fraud alert on myself and my husbands personal information. They will submit that to XXXX and XXXX as well. There is nothing else I can do right now, but this "" hard '' inquiry into our credit is now going to cause our credit score to go down when we have excellent credit. I feel dumb and was taken advantage of. Quicken Loans needs to correct this and cooperate and do what was asked by removing our information from their system.

The following items are UNKNOWN to ME. I dont get why youre claiming these are fraudulent or of a high risk nature. The documents Ive provided are legit. These are mine, filed with the appropriate agencies & support my position. Lets get the record straight!!! First of all I know that under Section 619 Obtaining information under false pretenses that any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18 United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. Most importantly, Ive never sent my documentation to anyone else which seems to be a claim that constitutes high-risk due to potential fraud. According to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) Determination That Dispute IsFrivolous or irrelevant ( A ) a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information. ( B ) Notice of determination. Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph ( A ) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. Again, under 617 Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [ 15U.S.C. 1681o ] a person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( 2 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

Ive sent EXPERIAN multiple letters that Im the one whos disputing the items that are UNKNOWN to me. In Experians responses that make the claim that have not initiated any disputes on my behalf due to the fraudulent or high risk nature, and the documents I provided have either been confirmed as fraudulent or deemed as high risk due to the potential for fraud. This is a complete joke. How in the world did they verify these claims? First of all, I know that under FCRA Section 619 Obtaining information under false pretenses that any person who knowingly and willfully obtains information on a consumer from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses shall be fined under title 18 United States Code, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both. Most importantly, I never sent my documentation to anyone else as it deemed as high risk due to the potential for fraud. Also, according to FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 3 ) Determination That Dispute Is Frivolous or Irrelevant ( A ) a consumer reporting agency may terminate a reinvestigation of information disputed by a consumer under that paragraph if the agency reasonably determines that the dispute by the consumer is frivolous or irrelevant, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed information. 

( B ) Notice of determination. Upon making any determination in accordance with subparagraph ( A ) that a dispute is frivolous or irrelevant, a consumer reporting agency shall notify the consumer of such determination not later than 5 business days after making such determination, by mail or, if authorized by the consumer for that purpose, by any other means available to the agency. 

Again, under FCRA 617 Civil liability for negligent noncompliance [ 15 U.S.C. 1681o ] Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure; and ( 2 ) in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under this section, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorneys fees as determined by the court.

I tried again and verified my information before submitting the payment. Declined. Merchant reached out to me to inform me the failure code was showing that it was declined due to credit limit. At this point I contacted Cash App, and of course they could only be reached via chat. I attempt to call their customer support line, and I got the standard, We are experiencing higher than normal call volumes. I returned to chat, and the so-called advocates told me it was declined due to incorrect expiration date or cvv even though I informed them that I attempted the transaction more than once. They claim they could not help me because they only could see one transaction and suggested I try again no matter how many times I told them that I did. I asked if it was being declined due to my credit limit because thats what the failure code is showing from the Merchant, and they said no I have a {$7000.00} limit. I asked if it was due to my card being flagged or restricted for fraud because of multiple high-dollar charge attempts, which they said no and claim that it not an issue on their end because there appears to be nothing wrong with my card or account. Their only suggestion was try another card. Throughout this entire experience, I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or a direct phone number to someone who can help find more answers because the conversation via chat was getting nowhere. They informed me I could try calling or chat with a manager, which I requested and attempted to call the phone number once more. However, I had to request a call back and got nowhere with the manager via chat. I kept getting told theres nothing wrong with my account or card despite the failure codes for the merchant POS showing otherwise, which I provided to them multiple times in black and white. After trying a few more times, I sent a screenshot showing the failure code again specifically saying declined by bank and instructing me to contact the bank associated with the card. I kept getting the same responses. The advocates claimed they were unable to see any transactions other than the very first one that failed due to the wrong expiration/cvv. They continued to just blame it on the merchant POS and offered no solutions. This all went on for a duration of 5 hours with no results.

I informed Cash App this is unacceptable, and I am not going to play the blame game. Also, not a single person through chat offered a solution or suggested to put a ticket in to address a potential glitch or system error. They just repeatedly blamed the merchant POS. 

After asking them to cancel my Cash Card because it clearly was rendered useless, I was told that I would have to do that myself and was instructed to report it lost or stolen, which I was not going to do because my card was not lost or stolen. I am also not doing Cash App any favors for their financial reporting and accepting blame for a useless card. After ending the chat, I received a call back from another representative who I told I have very little patience already dealing with Cash App, so I dont want her to waste my time- no due respect to her personally. She encouraged me to tell her whats going on, so I gave her a chance. This woman was the only redeeming quality about my experience because she listened, was empathic and did not treat me like an XXXX or XXXX. She tried to get answers by contacting the department on the back end, which got nowhere because they claim they are only able to work with the transactions they see. She did say it could be a delay in their system causing the other transactions not to come through, but her hands were tied basically. She was the only one to remotely even accept partial responsibility. 

To sum it all up, I attempted the same exact transaction with a different card, and the transaction went through. Obviously it was not an issue with the merchants POS. Like any other large company, Cash Apps customer service is useless and terrible. I tried to use the Cash App card merely out of convenience because it was somewhat of an emergency, and I did not have the time to wait for the payment to be posted, nor did I want to pay a large fee to have access to the funds instantly when I have a Cash Card - which by the way is the whole selling point of their card.

Shortly after depositing it, they put a freeze on my account. I got an email saying they needed a photo of my ID and a recent bank statement. I found this weird, and asked why but was not provided an answer.

I sent them what they needed, and never heard back. When I reached out again, they said they needed a bank statement in PDF form, a selfie with me holding my ID under my chin, and a photo of the back of my ID with all four corners visible.

Again, these are very weird requests. I was growing impatient and just sent it.

They replied back saying they needed the same thing. I said I already sent it, but I sent it again.

At this point Im furious, I go on their app to the customer service chat, and the lady, whose name was XXXX, said she sees all my documents, they were all perfect and exactly what they needed, and was transferring my case to a specialist. She said they had everything I needed and I should hear back from them within an hour.

I didnt, I didnt hear back for over two days. That was today, at XXXX am, they messaged me and said that I needed to upload the bank document in PDF form. 
I did, and luckily this was the fifth time I was asked, so I took a screenshot the last time to show it was in PDF form.

I already sent the PDF, of something they shouldnt need, Im my opinion.

3/14/2022,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"XXXX XXXX XXXX mistakenly reported a late payment to my credit report. On multiple occasions, XXXX representatives, including managers, have verbally committed to removing the erroneous late payment credit reporting, but XXXX has failed to fulfill their commitment. Below is the background. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made my regular mortgage payment of {$5800.00}. This was the amount of my standard monthly payment since XX/XX/XXXX. However, in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX increased my mortgage payment to {$6200.00} to cover an increased escrow balance that resulted from my home insurance cost increasing. My XXXX payment did cover my actual mortgage payment as was confirmed by multiple XXXX representatives. 

Normally I would have logged into my account to see if my mortgage payment had changed, but during this time, XXXX had switched to a new website that used two-factor authentication and for unknown reasons the system would not recognize my phone number and thus I was unable to login and see my statement. I called XXXX many times in XXXX and XXXX to resolve this issue, but no one ever picked up my call even after I waited on the phone for over two hours. In the end, I only found out that the XXXX payment had not covered the full escrow requirement when I received a call from XXXX indicating my mortgage was late. I promptly took care of the additional payment after the call. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX and explained the above situation. The representative that assisted me indicated that XXXX was having problems with the new website and that I was having trouble getting phone support because XXXX was short staffed due to the XXXX pandemic. The representative reversed the {$70.00} late fee on XX/XX/XXXX ( which clearly indicates that XXXX took responsibility for the miscommunication that led to wrong payment ). The representative also indicated that the error would be communicated to the credit agencies and the XX/XX/XXXX late payment would be removed.

I am aware that in accordance with Article 9, the assignment of a defaulted note is illegal. Both the assignee and the assigned are both liable for violations under 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 12 ). 

I have never received any documentation requesting validation from CITIBANK N.A. before they committed multiple violations under the FCRA and the FDCPA by furnishing this alleged debt to my consumer report including but not limited to 15 U.S. Code 1692d ( 4 ) which the FTC defines as debt parking. If CITIBANK N.A. can not provide me with proof, such as a tracking number, that they attempted to lawfully validate this alleged debt with me, the consumer, prior to furnishing it on my consumer report, this has been a fraudulently furnished account with forethought and malice as an attempt to bring harm to me and my financial reputation. 

According to what Ive been told, after the banking crisis banks were required to do certain things, make certain allotments to the public, and to cease and desist doing certain things regarding consumer credit transactions. I know I dont have to run it down to you verbatim what the laws say. You may glean my line of reasoning and assessment from Clearfield Trust Co. V. United States , S.Ct.

I've sent proof of these deceptive acts by Equifax to Equifax and to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
The deceptive acts in question were the re-aging of my U.S. Postal return receipt of my package that was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. Equifax re-aged the receipt of my dispute to XX/XX/XXXX. 
The tracking numbers on the signed green return receipt match the original sale receipt that was given to me by the U.S. Post Office on XX/XX/XXXX.

They told me to wait 30 days for the account to be corrected before calling back in Since then I've called ComenityXXXX XXXX about once a month and spent probably XXXX hours on the phone with them. I've talked to at least a dozen front line employees and half dozen supervisors They all seem to be able to see the problem but are powerless to change anything. I'm always told they are sending it to their back office for investigation but nothing ever comes from it. Or I'm told they requested correction and to call back in a few days but when I do I'm on the phone for an hour explaining my problem to someone who tells we the same thing When I initially enrolled by balance on the XXXX XXXX card was {$2200.00}. I have not charges anything to the card. I was to receive credit for two months late fee of {$41.00} each for making 4 on time payments, which I have. I have made {$220.00} worth of payments since then. My balance should be ( XXXX - XXXX - XXXX ) {$1900.00}, yet the last statement received says I owe {$2400.00} - a difference attributed to the late fees and interest they have been charging my account in error To further add insult to injury, Comenity/XXXX XXXX has started to report my account past due to the credit bureaus. This has impacted my credit score and resulted in adverse action taken by other creditors as well as an increase in the amount I have to pay for my car and renters insurance I have made numerous calls, spent hours of my time speaking to Comenity/XXXX XXXX and have been unable to resolve this.

I told XXXX that did not make any sense, if I paid my balance two months in a row there would be no interest to waive.

I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 120 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I immediately disputed this information with GLELSI and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ).

He wrote it extremely poorly, so Chase Bank flagged it as an altered check. Instead of flagging just the check/bouncing it, or even notifying me that there was an issue, they restricted my entire account. I called them back on XX/XX/2022 in the evening after noticing that my account had been restricted. The representative of Chase Bank that I spoke with assured me that all I had to do was wait 5 business days from the initial deposit and if it was a "" good check '' ( as he put it ) then everything would be fine and the restrictions on my account would be lifted. He told me that all the funds in question would be in my account by XX/XX/2022. I checked my account on that day and the funds had been deposited. The next day ( XX/XX/2022 ), I noticed that Chase had closed my account and withdrawn all of my money, aside from {$270.00} ( cash ) which I had just deposited into the account through an ATM. I called them again that night irate, and they told me that they closed my account and withdrew my funds themselves because I had failed to contact them within 10 days to resolve the issue. That was completely not true as I did try to reach out to them and after being passed around between multiple representatives I was told that all I had to do was sit and wait till the 5th bushiness day was up, which is what I did. He then hung up on me without helping me resolve this issue. I could not call back again as they were then closed at that point. I had to call back again the next morning on Saturday ( XX/XX/2022 ) at XXXX XXXX  to discuss to figure out what was going on and why they closed my account. The person I spoke with said they were having issues with verifying who was writing me the check. He told me because I did not reach out within 10 days they closed my account. I told him that was absolutely not true. He also told me that part of the issue with verifying the check was that if I looked at the check I would see that the check says that the company and bank from which the funds were coming from was located in XXXX. That is not what was on the check. The address on the check was in XXXX, Pennsylvania. He then spoke with their "" backroom '' and eventually got approval to reach out to my boss directly and verify all the information with him. They did so and were able to get in contact with him. My boss verified everything with them, and the Chase representative then told me that everything had been verified and that he would go ahead and reopen my account and that all my funds would be returned by XXXX XXXX on Monday XX/XX/2022. I asked him thoroughly whether the request would start being processed on Monday ( XX/XX/2022 ) or if it would be finalized and if all the money in my account ( including the original check in question for {$1900.00} ) would be back in my account or all of my money that was previously in my account aside from the {$1900.00} would be back in the account. He told me that my account would be reopened and ALL of my money would be back in my account ( including the {$1900.00} ). I checked on Monday ( XX/XX/2022 ) and nothing had changed, so I called back again at the end of the day and asked again what was going on and why they hadn't reopened my account and put my money back in it. The representative I spoke with told me that their "" backroom '' was reviewing the request but that it would actually take time to fully process it and that it would be done by today ( Wednesday XX/XX/2022 ) at XXXX XXXX and to call back again if it wasn't due to their being another issue. This means that I was given misinformation yet again by the representatives about when the issue would be resolved by. I called back again today as I saw that my account had finally been reopened, but not all my money had been put back in it. All of my money aside from the {$1900.00} had been returned to my account. So, I called back again today ( XX/XX/2022 ) around XXXX XXXX to see what the issue was now. The representative told me she did not know why the rest of my money had not yet been returned to me but that it would take time and tried to assure me that it would eventually be back in my account and to just wait. She would not give me an estimated time frame of when my money would be returned to me as she was not able to see that information, so I asked to speak with her supervisor who would be able to provide me with this information. While doing so, she had the audacity to tell me that they were doing me a favor by reopening my account and returning my money to me after she had just admitted that they were at fault for all of this. She connected me with her supervisor who told me that my remaining money was being held and suspended by them and that a request to have my money returned to me still hadn't been filled out and submitted yet, so if I didn't call to check in again on what was going on, it likely would never have been sent. I checked with my boss before making this call and he told me that the money had still not been returned to his account either, meaning that Chase would have kept the money. The supervisor then kept me on the phone while she filled out the request and submitted it. When she had finished, she told me that it may take up to Wednesday ( XX/XX/2022 ) for all of my money to finally be returned to me. 

Throughout this whole process, they gave me no warnings or notifications that this was occurring and I had to rely on myself noticing these things happening to reach out and figure out what was going on. They also continued to provide me with misinformation every step of the way. I had to call and speak with them a total of 5 times over two weeks to make progress.

We have had all of the funds from three accounts stolen from us from our accounts via the XXXX transfer program. None of these transfers were authorized by either one of us. Our funds were transferred to a XXXX bank account. The XXXX program is added to all accounts by Wells Fargo automatically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we went to our local bank branch in XXXX XXXX, Fl and we reported this fraud to a customer service rep and the rep said we needed to file a claim to dispute the unauthorized online XXXX transfers totaling {$870.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX ( Original Claim # : XXXX ) and their fraud department would investigate the claim and let us know their decision within 7-10 business days. 

After about 10 business days, we received a letter that our claim was DENIED! The letter erroneously stated that the customer service rep said that we authorized these transfers! That was absolutely 100 % untrue!! 

After hearing this, we went to another branch on XX/XX/XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX branch and spoke with the branch XXXX XXXX. 

That XXXX was appalled at what they said after we told her we did NOT approve or authorize ANY of the XXXX transfers as this money was set aside for our bills and she agreed that we were wronged and she re-filed another fraud claim ( # XXXX ). We again were told that unfortunately it would be yet another 7-10 business days before we get their decision. 

The letter we received dated XX/XX/XXXX states that "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we finalized our investigation and denied the claim number XXXX. Claim number XXXX was resolved and closed. '' Also on page 2 of the same letter, it states "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we filed claim number XXXX to re-dispute unauthorized online XXXX transfers totaling {$870.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, and posted to accounts ending in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. At this time claim number XXXX is still under investigation and the resolution will be communicated to you under separate cover. '' It has now been 13 business days and we still do not have a decision! 

Under the following section on your website I read the following : Error Resolution : Unauthorized EFTs We reviewed section # 5 and that is exactly what happened, a fraudster contacted my wife on her cellphone and said he was from Wells Fargo bank and there were suspicious transfers being processed right now and he was trying to help stop that from happening and put the money back into her account and it should be back in the account within 24-48 hours. My wife did not give them ANY account information or personal information either, in fact, she asked the caller "" How do I know you are from Wells Fargo? '' He told her to look at his number and compare it to the number on the back of her card and the numbers matched. 

"" For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs.

2/3/2021,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I contacted CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX to report that inXX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America ( BOA ) denied my request for an increase in my credit limit on my Bank of America credit card. At that time, it cited as its decision : *Utilization of your credit is too high *Current or past delinquency with one or more of your creditors *Too many consumer finance company accounts For more than a year, I have been renovating my home, so my credit utilization that BOA felt is too high is reflective of those renovations. My credit is current and well-managed. I disagree with BOA 's assessment of my credit utilization, but there appears to be little that I can do about this issue. However, I adamantly object to the remaining two reasons that BOA cited -- delinquencies and finance companies on my credit report. 

There were no delinquencies or finance companies listed on my credit report when I requested the credit increase in XXXX of XXXX. Therefore, when I submitted my complaint to CFPB in XXXX of XXXX, I specifically requested that BOA state exactly what delinquencies and finance companies it identified. 

In late XXXX of XXXX, I received a written response from a BOA representative named XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX regurgitated exactly what was stated in the original letter of denial that was sent to me in XXXX of XXXX. Mr. XXXX failed to satisfy my request to specifically state exactly what delinquencies and finance companies it identified. 

I faithfully review my credit file at the start of each year because I do not like surprises. I know exactly what is on my credit report. All errors or items of concern that I find are immediately reported for correction, which is why I am requesting that BOA/Mr. XXXX clearly identify by name the items that it cited as the reason for its decision. BOA is either deliberately misrepresenting the information it alleges is in my credit report or it is reviewing inaccurate information -- information that is not on the reports that I review every single year. I am attempting to get to the bottom of a problem that BOA alleges exists. Since it is making statements that I know are inaccurate, it must clarify those statements. 

I am again requesting that BOA provide me with the requested information. I will not consider this complaint closed until BOA has responded to my satisfaction.

Today, I received a letter stating that my claim was researched and their office found that the transactions were performed by myself or someone authorized to use my XXXX account. Therefore, the provisional credit I was given when I filed my claim would be reversed and my claim would be closed. 

I am writing to further explain the situation which occurred in hopes that I XXXX appeal their decision and receive a refund for the loss I incurred. 


On XX/XX/22 I found an item on the XXXX  app which I was interested in purchasing. It was a XXXX XXXX machine. The list price was {$500.00} by a seller named XXXX. 
I used XXXX to make the payment for the item as the seller informed me that he was unable to ship the merchandise using XXXX  shipping as there was a size/weight limit and the XXXX machine exceeded that limit. Therefore, I couldnt pay for the item through the XXXX app so I opted to do it through XXXX. 

Below is a series of screenshots from a text thread which ensued over the next couple of days. 
As you will see, he claimed initially, that my payment didnt go through, however, it was showing completed on my end and according to Wells Fargo XXXX payment was sent. The seller then told me his wifes account had limits so I would have to resend the payment to him instead. He also stated that their bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  told them I would be refunded in 3 days. He provided me another XXXX email. I told him I would resend the payment once I received my refund. He also sent me a receipt from a XXXX store showing the delivery charge. 
I agreed to send him the money for the shipping cost. He was not happy and at this point I began to suspect I was being scammed. The receipt he provided me from the XXXX store looked quite legitimate ( it is also included in the text thread attachments ), however I decided to call the actual store listed on the receipt to confirm my item was sent. 
The XXXX person I emailed informed me that it was indeed a false receipt. 

I decided it was best to inform my bank, Wells Fargo, as the fraudulent transaction occurred using XXXX which is a service that Wells Fargo provides its customers. 
When speaking with the representative who took my claim information, at no time did I deny sending the money to the fraudsters. My claim WAS NOT because someone else used my account without permission, but rather I was provided XXXX  different XXXX emails which I believed were legitimate XXXX customers and there was no flag or any indication that these individuals were suspicious. Although, I find it hard to believe that if they have been doing this awhile, no one had caught on and suspended them from using the XXXX service. 
I NEVER received the products/service which I paid for through XXXX so XXXX am disputing the fact that my claim was denied.

11/4/2021,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"I attempted to make a very important, large purchase using my Cash Card, and I accidentally used the wrong expiration date, so the payment was declined. I tried again and verified my information before submitting the payment. Declined. Merchant reached out to me to inform me the failure code was showing that it was declined due to credit limit. At this point I contacted Cash App, and of course they could only be reached via chat. I attempt to call their customer support line, and I got the standard, We are experiencing higher than normal call volumes. I returned to chat, and the so-called advocates told me it was declined due to incorrect expiration date or cvv even though I informed them that I attempted the transaction more than once. They claim they could not help me because they only could see one transaction and suggested I try again no matter how many times I told them that I did. I asked if it was being declined due to my credit limit because thats what the failure code is showing from the Merchant, and they said no I have a {$7000.00} limit. I asked if it was due to my card being flagged or restricted for fraud because of multiple high-dollar charge attempts, which they said no and claim that it not an issue on their end because there appears to be nothing wrong with my card or account. Their only suggestion was try another card. Throughout this entire experience, I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or a direct phone number to someone who can help find more answers because the conversation via chat was getting nowhere. They informed me I could try calling or chat with a manager, which I requested and attempted to call the phone number once more. However, I had to request a call back and got nowhere with the manager via chat. I kept getting told theres nothing wrong with my account or card despite the failure codes for the merchant POS showing otherwise, which I provided to them multiple times in black and white. After trying a few more times, I sent a screenshot showing the failure code again specifically saying declined by bank and instructing me to contact the bank associated with the card. I kept getting the same responses. The advocates claimed they were unable to see any transactions other than the very first one that failed due to the wrong expiration/cvv. They continued to just blame it on the merchant POS and offered no solutions. This all went on for a duration of 5 hours with no results.

I informed Cash App this is unacceptable, and I am not going to play the blame game. Also, not a single person through chat offered a solution or suggested to put a ticket in to address a potential glitch or system error. They just repeatedly blamed the merchant POS. 

After asking them to cancel my Cash Card because it clearly was rendered useless, I was told that I would have to do that myself and was instructed to report it lost or stolen, which I was not going to do because my card was not lost or stolen. I am also not doing Cash App any favors for their financial reporting and accepting blame for a useless card. After ending the chat, I received a call back from another representative who I told I have very little patience already dealing with Cash App, so I dont want her to waste my time- no due respect to her personally. She encouraged me to tell her whats going on, so I gave her a chance. This woman was the only redeeming quality about my experience because she listened, was empathic and did not treat me like an XXXX or XXXX. She tried to get answers by contacting the department on the back end, which got nowhere because they claim they are only able to work with the transactions they see. She did say it could be a delay in their system causing the other transactions not to come through, but her hands were tied basically. She was the only one to remotely even accept partial responsibility. 

To sum it all up, I attempted the same exact transaction with a different card, and the transaction went through. Obviously it was not an issue with the merchants POS. Like any other large company, Cash Apps customer service is useless and terrible. I tried to use the Cash App card merely out of convenience because it was somewhat of an emergency, and I did not have the time to wait for the payment to be posted, nor did I want to pay a large fee to have access to the funds instantly when I have a Cash Card - which by the way is the whole selling point of their card.
